Article on alterate investment was good read from the portfolio management perspective but this type of investment in recent years has really turned out to be the riskest. we can see the examples of so many SPACS which earned absurd valuation and were added to these kind of portfolios but now are really trading at throw away prices. So I still think for the good investor the diversification portfolio should give more value to value stocks ,then to some good growth stocks and then very little to these gamble assets.

I think that federal funds rate has a negative correlation with GDP. When the federal funds rate goes down, the commercial loan interest rates go down too. This means that people can borrow cheaply and invest in their businesses, which will result in higher gross domestic product.
