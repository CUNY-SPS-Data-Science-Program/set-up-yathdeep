Hello Prof,
Thanks for bringing this interesting article. We all can really say there is a real pain in the market due to this inflation.
I feel FED should have taken this action sooner(mid of 2021) trying to control the inflation rather than waiting this long. It is always good to control the things in steps rather than trying to bring the things to a complete stop to control it. They set too much complacency. Also I think FED should not try that hard because there are other aspects as we saw in the presentation are contributing to this . Once the other areas which are causing inflicting pain are resolved the supply chain will get better and we should start to see the things come down in price and hence the inflation.
Ending the QT and also trying to curb inflation at the same time does not seem to be good idea . Though both are good weapons to reduce inflation but should not be using all weapons together ..again this is just what I feel.

Best Regards,
Deepak
